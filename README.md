Project Description:
I developed a data analysis project focused on my Netflix viewing activity using Python and the pandas library. The goal was to understand my watching habits, identify trends, and visualize the data.

Key Features:

âœ… Data loading and processing from a CSV file exported from my Netflix account.

âœ… Viewing time analysis â€“ calculating total watch time across different time periods.

âœ… Data visualization â€“ charts and graphs illustrating key insights.

âœ… Basic statistics â€“ average watch time, most active days/hours.

Technologies Used:

ðŸŸ¢ Python â€“ core programming language

ðŸŸ¢ pandas â€“ data analysis and manipulation

ðŸŸ¢ matplotlib â€“ data visualization

ðŸŸ¢ Jupyter Notebook â€“ interactive analysis and reporting

Achievements:

âœ… Processed real-world data and extracted meaningful insights.

âœ… Enhanced skills in data analysis, pandas, and visualization techniques.

âœ… Potential for further expansion, such as predictive models for viewing preferences.
